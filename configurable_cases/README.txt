Bigtreetech TFT35 E3 V3.0 Rear Case multiple variants configurable by Arminth on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4648575
Remix of: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4363077
by Rene Loeppen (Luke700)

This is a remix of the design of Luke700. It was lacking some openings for the various connectors on the display.
I have just imported the original model and added configurable options for
-Wifi
-SWD
-Extra-connectors: Power, PS-On, Fil-Det, UART3 and UART4
-EXP1 and 2
In the examples, the openings for EXP1 and EXP are always there.
Howto:
Place the .scad file and the E3_Pro_TFT35_Rear_Case.stl in the same directory. Then open the .scad file in OpenSCAD and fill in the configurable varaibles according to your taste and needs.
Then press the render-button, wait and after finishing, save the stl-file.

Thanks a lot for the great original design to @Luke700!

Enjoy!
